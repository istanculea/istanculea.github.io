          <h2>Why Infrastructure as Code Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Managing cloud infrastructure manually is like building a house without blueprints—it works until it doesn't. 
            When I joined the infrastructure team, we were spending countless hours on repetitive deployment tasks, 
            fighting configuration drift, and scrambling to recreate environments when things went wrong.
          </p>

          <h2>The Problem We Faced</h2>
          <p>
            Our Azure environment was a mix of manually created resources and scattered ARM templates. 
            Each deployment was an adventure:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deployments took 3-4 hours because everything was manual</li>
            <li>Development and production environments were subtly different</li>
            <li>No one really knew what was running where</li>
            <li>Rolling back meant crossing fingers and hoping for the best</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Enter Terraform</h2>
          <p>
            We chose Terraform because it offered something ARM templates couldn't: simplicity and consistency. 
            Instead of wrestling with complex JSON, we could describe our infrastructure in readable HCL.
          </p>

          <h3>Starting Small</h3>
          <p>
            We didn't try to boil the ocean. We started with our development environment—a simple web app 
            with a database and storage account. This gave us confidence and taught us the basics without 
            risking production workloads.
          </p>

          <h3>Building Reusable Modules</h3>
          <p>
            Once we had our first success, we extracted common patterns into modules. Our "web-app" module 
            could spin up a complete environment with proper networking, monitoring, and security—all 
            configured consistently every time.
          </p>

          <h2>The Results Speak for Themselves</h2>
          <p>
            Six months after our Terraform implementation, the transformation was remarkable:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deployment time dropped from hours to <strong>15 minutes</strong></li>
            <li>Zero configuration drift issues</li>
            <li>New environments created in minutes, not days</li>
            <li>Complete deployment history and easy rollbacks</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Lessons We Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Every implementation teaches you something. Here's what worked for us:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start simple—resist the urge to over-engineer from day one</li>
            <li>Remote state is non-negotiable for team environments</li>
            <li>Consistent tagging saves your sanity during cost analysis</li>
            <li>Test your modules like you would test code</li>
            <li>Keep your state files secure—they contain sensitive information</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Terraform didn't just change how we deploy infrastructure—it changed how we think about it. 
            Infrastructure became predictable, version-controlled, and collaborative. The time we used to 
            spend on manual deployments is now invested in building better systems and solving real problems.
