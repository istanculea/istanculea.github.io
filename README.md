portofoliosite

This repository hosts the personal portfolio website that showcases my background in cloud engineering, automation, and operations. The site is built with modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Tailwindâ€‘CSS) and is deployed on GitHub Pages



ðŸš€ Quick Start

If youâ€™d like to run the portfolio locally or tweak it:



\# Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/ionut-stanculea/ionut-stanculea.github.io.git

cd ionut-stanculea.github.io



\# Open the index.html file in your browser (no build step needed)

open index.html   # macOS

start index.html  # Windows

xdg-open index.html  # Linux

The site is static, so no server or build tool is required.



ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I am a Cloud, Infrastructure \& Operations Engineer with over 7 years of experience building and managing scalable infrastructure on Azure and AWS. My focus lies in:



Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, ARM templates)

CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps)

Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)

Observability \& Incident Management (Grafana, Prometheus, Azure Monitor, PagerDuty)

I thrive on automating repetitive tasks, improving reliability, and mentoring junior engineers.
