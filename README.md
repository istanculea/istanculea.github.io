ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I am a Cloud, Infrastructure \& Operations Engineer with over 7 years of experience building and managing scalable infrastructure on Azure and AWS. My focus lies in:



Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, ARM templates)

CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps)

Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)

Observability \& Incident Management (Grafana, Prometheus, Azure Monitor, PagerDuty)

I thrive on automating repetitive tasks, improving reliability, and mentoring junior engineers.
